Today was the end of week 5 of the React NuCamp course. This week we went over Actions, Reducers, Redux
Thunk, Client-server Communicaiton, Fetch and React Animations. A lot to learn in one week 
and it was the hardest week so far. Hopefully with hard work and studying I can get understand
and use React in future projects.
