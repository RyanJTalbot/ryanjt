I'm reading a great article on NPM in comparisson to grunt and gulp. Here's a snippet, "When 
using Grunt or Gulp, the packages specific to that build tool are usually just wrappers on 
the main package. For instance, gulp-sass is really a Gulp specific wrapper to node-sass. 
We can go straight to the source and just use node-sass with npm!" 

If you've got the time I suggest giving it a read!
