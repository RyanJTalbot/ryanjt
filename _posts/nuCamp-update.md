I'm curently taking the NuCamp full-stack developer course. This is week 5 and 
the end of the first course, Bootstrap and JavaScript. I feel comfortable using 
Bootstrap now, which is something I've never used before the course. I'm still not sure
how much I will use it in the future or how useful it will be but I think it's something
worth knowing.
