Quick update: There is still a quarantine going on. I've had to go into work

and 1,969 dead. The USA has 1.18 Million confirmed cases and 68,276 dead. Here's a link
to a easy to make line graph made with chart.js. <a href="https://ryanjt.dev/coding/javascript/charts/index.html" target="_blank" alt="coronavirus graph louisiana">Coronavirus Louisiana chart</a>
