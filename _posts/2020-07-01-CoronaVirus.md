In Louisiana the reported cases of Covid-19 for Wednesday July 1, 2020 is 2,083. The percent positive rate for today is 
8.8%, which isn't good. With all that being said the amount of people not wearing masks, going out to restaurants, or stores
is alarming. It will be interesting to see what the local and state government does, since the federal government has abdicated
all of its power/responsibility in fighting this pandemic. 

update: This afternoon the Mayor announced that starting tomorrow it will be mandatory to wear a mask in public. It's about time!
