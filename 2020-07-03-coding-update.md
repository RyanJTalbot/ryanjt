Quick update on what I've been up to. My first React Native class is tomorrow. I'm looking forward to 
but I know it will be difficult, but i'm up for the challenge. Over the past week I've been dipping my 
toes into React Native while reviewing React. I'm starting to get more comfortable with React but still have 
a ways to go.
